### GAME_RULES

A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual game uses “X” and “O”.

* The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (we call him/her player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (we call him/her player 2).

* Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.

* A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
      * One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
      * If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
